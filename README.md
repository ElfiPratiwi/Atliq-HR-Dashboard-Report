# HR-Dashboard-Report

In this project, we analyze the data from HR and create a dashboard based on their requirements.
The dataset consists of 3 months of attendance data from April to July 2023.

The requirements are as follows:
1. Analyze the dataset for insights.
2. Determine the employees' work preferences.
3. Calculate the percentage of employees present in a given week or month.
4. Determine the sick leave percentage in a given week or month.
5. Determine the work-from-home percentage in a given week or month.

All of the data preparation, from cleaning to manipulating, is conducted on Power BI.
